##What is the goal?

The goal is to show howto use Angular with the Ionic Framework to build a portable app. To do that the app is build with Angular and Typescript from top to bottom and Ionic packages it to an app that can be deployed on the smartphone. That makes it possible for Angular Developers to develop apps with their available skills. 

##What is is?

The app offers a login to support multiple users on a smartphone and authenticate the user. The user can see the exchange rates of 4 crypto currencies of 2 exchanges. Each of the rates offers a detail page with a chart and a link to the order book page. The order book page offers a access to the order book of the exchanges and the sending of an order. The order can be seen and canceled on the orders page. To send the orders the ids and tokens have to be provided on the settings page. The ids and tokens are stored encrypted.
